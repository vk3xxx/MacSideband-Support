# Lower Sideband Privacy Policy

Effective date: 18 July 2026

Lower Sideband is a native Reticulum and LXMF messaging application provided by Mark Beacham. Privacy is a core design requirement: the app does not require an account, does not include advertising or third-party analytics, and does not sell personal information.

## Data the developer collects

The developer does not collect message contents, contacts, attachments, voice recordings, precise location, usage analytics, advertising identifiers, or diagnostic data from the app.

Lower Sideband stores its application state and attachments in encrypted form on the device. Reticulum and LXMF identity keys are stored in the Apple Keychain.

## Messages and network operation

Messages, attachments, voice traffic, contact information, and optional telemetry are sent only when the user chooses to communicate with another destination. Message and attachment contents are protected by Reticulum/LXMF cryptography in transit.

Lower Sideband can connect through local or public Reticulum gateways. A gateway operator or Internet service provider may observe ordinary network metadata such as IP addresses, connection times, and traffic volume. Gateway operators are independent of Lower Sideband and have their own policies. They should not receive plaintext message content from encrypted Reticulum links.

## iCloud sync

iCloud sync is optional. When enabled, conversation state and attachments are stored in the user's private CloudKit database. Lower Sideband encrypts CloudKit payloads with AES-GCM before upload using key material held in the user's synchronizable Keychain. Apple processes iCloud data under the user's Apple account and Apple's privacy terms.

## Safety reports

Users can report a contact or an individual incoming message from the conversation actions. Lower Sideband opens a user-addressed email draft to the developer; the user reviews and sends it explicitly. The draft includes the contact destination and, for a message report, its identifier and date. It does not automatically include message text, attachments, telemetry, contact notes, display names, or cryptographic keys. Any additional details the user chooses to add are used only to investigate and respond to the safety report.

## Device permissions

Lower Sideband requests access only when a relevant feature is used:

- Camera: scan contact and encrypted paper-message QR codes.
- Microphone: record voice messages and participate in encrypted voice calls.
- Location: attach current location telemetry when the user explicitly chooses to share it.
- Local network: discover and connect to Reticulum gateways and peers.
- Notifications: alert the user to incoming activity when enabled.

The user can change these permissions in Apple Settings.

## Data retention and deletion

Users control their local conversations, messages, attachments, call history, and telemetry. These can be deleted in the app. Removing the app deletes its local application data subject to Apple's device backup and Keychain behaviour. Users who enabled iCloud sync can manage iCloud data through their Apple account and devices.

## Children

Lower Sideband is not directed to children under 13. The app does not knowingly collect children's personal information.

## Changes

Material changes to this policy will be published at this URL with a revised effective date.
